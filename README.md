bp_zones_updated.json contains data for wigo carsharing zone since July 23 2024 - with area km2 according to that version


bp_zones_updated_accentfix.json may be used for geoJSON heatmaps - zone data loaded into wigo carsharing SQL is unable to use accented letters - this is fixed here


To get zone sizing/area for earlier time periods, refer to FÃ¡bian Attila/earlier map versions - although they may have a different segmentation logic than the current one.

To note: using current area data to calculate /km2 metrics will not be valid in some cases for data before July 23 2024.
